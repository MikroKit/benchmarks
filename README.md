# mion Http Benchmarks

- These benchmarks are based on the [fastify benchmarks](https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks) repo!
- `@MionKit/http` is part of the mion Framework. It uses and RPC style router!
- **This package shows how fast is mion comparatively to full featured frameworks like fastify and others.**
- You can find a full list of many other small and faster servers in the original fastify benchmarks repo.
- For cold-start metrics see [cold-starts.md](./COLD-STARTS.md)

ðŸ“š [Full mion framework documentation here!](https://github.com/MionKit/mion)

#### Running the benchmarks

```sh
# running all benchmarks and update all readmes
npm run report
```

#### Cold Starts

- Cold start times: This is a metric we specially want to keep in check as fast cold start times are essential for serverless environments  
  [COLD-STARTS.md](COLD-STARTS.md)

## What's tested

The test consist of an `updateUser` request where the fields of the user must be validated, the `lastUpdate` field is a date that must be transformed into a JS Date (deserialized), then add one month and send back in the response.

```ts
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  surname: string;
  lastUpdate: Date;
}

// ### mion ###
// the received user by the route is already validated and deserialized
// user.lastUpdate is already a js date instead and string (result of JSON.parse)
export const routes: Routes = {
  updateUser: (context, user: User): User => {
    user.lastUpdate.setMonth(user.lastUpdate.getMonth() + 1);
    return user;
  },
};

// ### Express ###
// A plugin must be used to parse the json body
// validation must be done manually and user.lastUpdate must be deserialized manually into a date
// in this case developer would have to manually write `isUser` and `deserializeUser` functions. (check src code fo those functions)
app.post("/updateUser", function (req, res) {
  const rawUser = req.body?.updateUser;
  if (!isUser(rawUser)) throw "app error, invalid parameter, not a user";
  const user = deserializeUser(rawUser);
  user.lastUpdate.setMonth(user.lastUpdate.getMonth() + 1);
  res.json(user);
});
```

#### Notes on current results:

mion is focused on being lightweight and fast so it can be run in serverless environments. We run the benchmarks before every PR gets merged to ensure there is no performance regression. There are [PRs](https://github.com/MionKit/mion/pull/48) that has been rejected because due to performance regression.

Our goal is to perform similar to fastify as it is the industry standard in terms of performance. Please always take benchmarks as general guidelines as you might obtain different results in your real world application. we just run the benchmarks to ensure there is no performance degradation when new features/fixes are added to mion.

We are aware that the memory consumption is a bit higher than other frameworks, this is in part because there is [types cache](https://docs.deepkit.io/english/runtime-types.html#_type_cache) storing all extra run type metadata of the code, and partly due to some design decision to not reuse the native request and response objects within mion routes.

This said it is the baseline memory which is a bit Higher (when the code gets loaded) and mion memory keeps steady under heavy workloads. Please note both mion and @deepkit/type are still in beta an there is room for improvement.

Throughput is usually bigger on mion as we send/receive slightly more data in the request/response body compared to other frameworks.
